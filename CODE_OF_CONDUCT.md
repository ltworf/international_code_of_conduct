International code of conduct
=============================

No USA cultural imperialism allowed
-----------------------------------

This project welcomes every contributor from any background. For this reason we can't let the USA and USA influenced politically correct culture dictate conduct for everyone.

Contributors are not expected to keep themselves up to date on social media about the current list of forbidden words.

Achieving social justice is important. Being superficial about it only to feel morally superior is not the way to achieve it and is not tolerated here.


The code of conduct only pertains this project
----------------------------------------------

This document only applies to the project and the communication channels.

It does not apply to anything any contributor might say or do outside of project channels.

It only applies to contributors. People whose only contribution is a code of conduct complaint are not contributors.


Offensive language
------------------

Try to be nice.

Offending other people is not allowed.

Foul language is allowed.

People often contribute to this project in their own time and are not paid, for this reason asking contributors to behave "professionally" makes no sense. Hobbies do not require professionality.

Jokes are allowed.

It can happen to unintentionally offend someone. Do not reiterate the offensive behaviour, provided that the request is reasonable.

People who are easily offended by things not intended to be offensive must try to become more tolerant towards other people, other cultures and their ways of expressing themselves.

It is not allowed to be offended on behalf of others. Please do not presume to know what others are thinking.

Examples of allowed language:

* This software is retarded
* This program runs like shit
* This bug is annoying

Examples of disallowed language:

* You are retarded
* You are shitty and so is your program


Skill discrimination is absolutely fine
---------------------------------------

Unlike other code of conducts, this allows skill discrimination. Contributors are not paid to be teachers.

It is nice if they have time and patience to mentor potential contributors, but it is also fine to turn down low quality contributions with little explaination.

Conflict resolution
-------------------

This code of conduct is inevitably vague. Follow the intention rather than the letter.

The final word rests with the project owners or their delegates.


Changes to license or code of conduct
-------------------------------------

If you disagree with the license, feel free to start your own project from scratch.

If you disagree with the code of conduct, please remind that you are not forced to contribute.
