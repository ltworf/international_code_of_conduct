International code of conduct
=============================

Code of conduct for international projects with international contributors.

Motivation
----------

I'm tired of people with little knowledge of world history and cultures who self appoint themselves as censors and decide what can and can't be said, and I suspect they do it for visibility, career and validation from their peers.

It seems automatic scanners are increasingly demanding code of conducts and encouraging people to contribute one.

I could not find one that fit (although the one from sqlite comes very close).

Adopt it
--------

Copy the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file into your repository.
